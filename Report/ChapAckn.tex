I would like to thank Dr Georgiou for his continued support and advice throughout the project, particularly in relation to the biomedical engineering aspects of this project. I would also like to that Professor Toumazou for his advice early in the project. Finally, I would like to the acknowledge Yuanqi Hu whose support has been invaluable in developing this project and without whom there would have been no basis for this project.
